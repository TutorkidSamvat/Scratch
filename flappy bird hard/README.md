# Flappy Bird Hard - TurboWarp Project

## Project Overview
This project is a challenging version of the classic **Flappy Bird** game, developed in **TurboWarp**. The player controls a bird that flaps through obstacles in a harder and more fast-paced environment, testing their reflexes and timing.

## Features
- **Increased Difficulty**: Obstacles are harder to avoid, making the game more challenging than the original Flappy Bird.
- **Responsive Controls**: Click to make the bird flap and navigate through gaps.
- **TurboWarp Optimized**: Designed for TurboWarp to take advantage of smoother performance and extended game customization options.

## How It Works
The player controls a bird that flaps upward each time the player clicks. The objective is to avoid the oncoming pipes while collecting points for passing through gaps. The game's difficulty is increased with faster speeds or narrower gaps.

## How to Play
1. Open the project in **TurboWarp** (https://turbowarp.org).
2. Click the green flag to start the game.
3. Click to make the bird flap.
4. Avoid hitting the pipes and try to score as high as possible!

## Installation & Usage
1. Visit the [TurboWarp Editor](https://turbowarp.org/editor).
2. Upload or import the project file.
3. Press the green flag to start the game.
4. Use mouse click to control the bird.

## Customization
- **Adjust Difficulty**: Change the speed of the game or narrow the gaps between obstacles to make the game more or less difficult.
- **Character Customization**: Replace the bird sprite with your own character to personalize the game.
- **Add Power-Ups**: Introduce power-ups like shields or slow-motion effects to help the player survive longer.
