# 3D Well Rotation with Mouse - TurboWarp Project

## Project Overview
This project features a 3D well that rotates interactively based on mouse movement, developed using the TurboWarp platform (Scratch mod). The project showcases the basics of 3D modeling and interaction within TurboWarp's enhanced Scratch environment.

## Features
- **3D Well Design**: A visually appealing well created with simple 3D modeling techniques.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Rotate the well by moving your mouse, providing an interactive experience.
- **TurboWarp Compatibility**: Built and optimized for TurboWarp, taking advantage of its extended features beyond Scratch.

## How It Works
The 3D well rotates as the user moves the mouse cursor across the screen. The X and Y mouse positions are used to calculate the rotation angle, making the well spin horizontally or vertically based on the user's input.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in **TurboWarp** (https://turbowarp.org).
2. Move your mouse across the screen to rotate the 3D well.
3. Enjoy exploring the 3D model interactively!

## Installation & Usage
1. Visit the [TurboWarp Editor](https://turbowarp.org/editor).
2. Upload or import the project file.
3. Click the green flag to start the project.
