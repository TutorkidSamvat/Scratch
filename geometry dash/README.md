# Geometry Dash - TurboWarp Project

## Project Overview
This project is a recreation of the popular **Geometry Dash** game, developed in **TurboWarp** (a Scratch mod). It features a player-controlled character that jumps over obstacles to reach the end of a level. The game is fast-paced and requires precision timing, almost like the original Geometry Dash.

## Features
- **Jump Mechanics**: Tap to make the character jump over obstacles.
- **Obstacle Courses**: Navigate through challenging obstacles.
- **TurboWarp Optimized**: Built for TurboWarp to ensure smooth performance and additional customization beyond the Scratch editor.

## How It Works
The player controls a geometric character that moves automatically, and the objective is to jump over obstacles and avoid collisions. The game uses simple controls and timing mechanics, making it fun and engaging for all ages.

## How to Play
1. Open the project in **TurboWarp** (https://turbowarp.org).
2. Click the green flag to start the game.
3. Click to make the character jump.
4. Avoid obstacles!
## Installation & Usage
1. Visit the [TurboWarp Editor](https://turbowarp.org/editor).
2. Upload or import the project file.
3. Press the green flag to start the game.
4. Jump over obstacles using the spacebar or mouse click to avoid collisions.

## Customization
- **Character Skins**: Customize the player character by changing costumes or importing new ones.
- **Change Backgrounds**: Add your own background images to create different environments.
